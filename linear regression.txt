Aim: Practical of simple /Multiple linear Regression.

Theory:

- A supervised technique used for predicting the value when the data is continuous of real valued is known as regression. Regression consist of variable known as t or output variable and Independent variable known as or input variables.

Examples of the task in which the regression. Cant be used are:

•Predicting the house price

Predicting age of person Predicting nationality of person

Predicting stock price of the community etc. Some of the important features of linear regression are as belows:

•Linear regression is a fast f a fast & easy to use to model technique and is mainly useful when relationship is modelled f is not extremly Complex

• Linear regression is not

fewer

amounts
Regression is divided mainly into two types which are!

1) simple Regression:

It has only one feature and its simple to use & develop, simple regression is further classified into simple linear regression and simple non-linear regression.

2. Multiple Regression:-

It has two more than features & its little Complex to develop with respect to simple regression
